The GPS must be associated with a controller on an appropriate comm link.

Protocol   | Notes
-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------
[NTCIP]    | same controller as [DMS] / weather sensor (on pin 2)
[RedLion]  | controller on separate comm link for modem (tcp port ????)
[SierraGX] | controller on separate comm link for modem (tcp port 9494)

The GPS location will be polled on the _long poll period_ of the [comm config].
The `Query GPS` button can be used to manually poll the co√∂rdinates.
