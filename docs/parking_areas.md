# Parking Areas

The number of available spaces in a parking area can be published on the web,
or displayed on a DMS.  A parking area could be a rest area or a parking garage.
The honeybee server can publish parking area information compatible with the
MAASTO truck parking information management system (TPIMS).

A special [corridor] must be associated with the parking area in order to allow
counting available spaces.  Within that corridor, detectors with the **parking**
lane type will be used.  Lanes 1 (front) and 2 (rear) are reserved for a _head_
parking space.  If applicable, lanes 3 (front) and 4 (rear) are for the _tail_.

## Parking Area Action Tag

A `[paâ€¦]` [action tag] is replaced with the number of available parking spaces
to be displayed on a DMS.  The tag has three parameters, separated by commas.
 - Parking area ID
 - Text to display if available spaces is below the low threshold
 - Text to display if parking area is closed

### Example

```
REST AREA 2 MILES[nl]PARKING [pa1,LOW,CLOSED]
```
